  cardType: Keter
  cardDescription: "SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of
    roughly 60 m\xB3 (or 2000 ft\xB3). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its
    interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One
    wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible
    from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination,
    appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances
    produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented
    DNA sequences for each object in the room."
